# GPO-Backup-Folder-Renamer

The objective of the provided code is to create a C# console application that recursively processes a folder structure, searching for "gpreport.xml" files within subfolders. When an "gpreport.xml" file is found, the application extracts a "Name" element from the XML and uses it to rename the containing folder. This renaming ensures that folder names are sanitized to conform to the file system's naming restrictions, replacing invalid characters with underscores. The primary goals are to automate the renaming process and maintain a clean and compliant folder structure.
